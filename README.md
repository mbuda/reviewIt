# This is my Ruby on Rails Project.


## I used these gems:

* *rmagick* methods: resize_to_fit for covers
* *carrierwave* uploader for covers from URL or local disk
* *simple_form* forms for adding end editing reviews
* *less-rails* using less, not scss for css generation
* *twitter-bootstrap-rails* bootstrap for views
* *navigasmic* menu generation
* *cloudinary* cloud storage for images
* *will_paginate* for pagination


I also added about site, changed all .erb files to HAML, override some bootstrap settings, made infinite scrolling(check this [tutorial](http://christianvarga.com/simple-infinite-scroll-with-rails-and-jquery/) and searching by author, title, reviewer.
